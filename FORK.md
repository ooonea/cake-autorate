# This fork

Development home for my own cake-autorate work, running on a NixOS router on a
Starlink line. Upstream is <https://github.com/lynxthecat/cake-autorate>; this
fork is not a competing project and carries no ambition to become one.

## Branches

| branch | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `master` | a plain mirror of upstream. Never commit here — it exists so everything else can be rebased onto a clean base. |
| `homelab` | **what actually runs on my hardware**: `master` plus the patches below. This is the branch my NixOS flake vendors. |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `harden/*` | one branch per upstream pull request, each based on `master`. |

Sync:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git push origin upstream/master:master        # move the mirror
git rebase master homelab                     # replay the local patches
```

If the rebase conflicts, the patch has been overtaken by upstream — check
whether it is still needed before resolving it.

## What `homelab` carries, and why

**Reject non-numeric RTT samples.** fping reports a negative RTT when the system
clock steps backwards mid-ping, which happens on this box when chrony
disciplines the clock after boot. `10#${rtt_us//.}` cannot represent a negative,
the arithmetic error kills the main loop, and the trap exits 0 — so systemd
records success, does not restart, and the shaper silently stops adapting.
Observed twice, out of six backward steps since July.

The mechanism is specific to fping: it prints such a value (`sprint_tm()` has a
branch labelled `/* negative (unexpected) */` that formats it `%.2g`), whereas
iputils ping clamps it to zero and warns. It also depends on the build — with
`HAVE_SO_TIMESTAMPNS` defined, which is the default on Linux, fping takes its
timestamps from `CLOCK_REALTIME` rather than `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`.

Proposed upstream as #392. The guard covers the fping parser arm only: iputils
clamps a backward step to zero rather than reporting it, so the ping arm cannot
receive a value that breaks the arithmetic. It uses a glob class check rather
than a regex — `[[ =~ ]]` recompiles the ERE on every sample, which is ~65x the
cost on that hot path.

**Declare the `sqm_*` cake option keys.** `sqm-setup.sh`, in
<https://github.com/ooonea/cake-autorate-openrc>, creates the qdiscs that
cake-autorate then adjusts, and reads its CAKE option strings from the config.
Undeclared keys make config validation reject the instance file, and the daemon
exits without explaining why.

## Contributing back

Anything meant for upstream is branched from `master`, never from `homelab`, so
it carries no local divergence. I am no longer developing against upstream's
main line; if something here is useful to anyone, ping me and I will prepare it
as a clean patch.
